# Convex Hull Algorithms Visualization

An interactive **Java + JavaFX** application that visualizes the runtime and execution of various **Convex Hull algorithms**.  
Developed as part of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course to help visualize and compare different algorithmic approaches in computational geometry.

## üöÄ Features
- Real-time visualization of Convex Hull construction.
- Interactive point placement by clicking on the canvas.
- Multiple algorithms implemented from scratch:
  - Brute Force
  - Jarvis March (Gift Wrapping)
  - Graham Scan
  - Quick Elimination
  - Quick Hull
- Runtime performance comparison between algorithms.
- Step-by-step animation of hull formation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Java** ‚Äî Core application logic.
- **JavaFX** ‚Äî GUI windowing and visualization.
